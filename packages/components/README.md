## ⌨️ Development

### Node version

First of all let's use version 16 of node so we don't have compatibility problems, for this we can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) just run in the repository folder the command:

```bash
$ nvm use
```

This command will look for the .nvmrc file and will find the version with which the project was created.
